    "Pandas' `read_csv()` function allows you to create a DataFrame that contains the data stored inside of a given CSV file. The function has a huge number of options that you can pass in as *keyword arguments* in order to change how the CSV file is interpreted. You can review all of these options in [the Pandas documentation here.](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html) In this case, `read_csv()` should get all of the data successfully with the default options, but the datatypes that it chooses may not always be the best ones. In particular, the `Album Release Date` column will be interpreted as a string by default. This is not \"wrong\", but it will make certain tasks more difficult later on. How you handle this is up to you—the following are three (of several possible) choices for how to handle this typing issue:\n",
    "1. Choose a setting for `read_csv()` that forces Pandas to parse the column as a `datetime` object. (Less code but more documentation reading.)\n",
    "2. Replace the column after reading the CSV by using [`to_datetime()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.to_datetime.html). In particular, you should be aware that some dates have Day, Month, and Year whereas some have just the Year. You could almost say that the format is *\"mixed\"...*(Less code but more documentation reading.)\n",
    "3. Keep the column's type as a string and just parse out the year yourself. (Less reading but more code.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the `read_songs()` function. In Checkpoint 1, use the `head()` method to inspect the first few rows of your DataFrame and make sure that it looks OK!"

The linked documentation has an illuminating example. Once you have each song's year, you can solve the problem in one or two more steps with either filtering or [`.value_counts()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Series.value_counts.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "**If you're using a `str` object**, then you'll have to extract the year by parsing that out of the string. Inspect the column manually and see if you can identify which positions the year occupies in the date strings. (Is it the same for both date formats found in the file?) You can mimic typical Python string slicing (i.e. `s[start:stop:step]`) with the Pandas function [`str.slice()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Series.str.slice.html) function. Once you have a way of isolating the year, the problem can be solved with filtering or `.value_counts()`."

    "## 4. Tracking Genres over Time\n",
    "\n",
    "Spotify has a huge set of music genres that it uses to tag each song. Some of the genres they use are remarkably specific (\"duluth indie\"), totally obtuse (\"bubblegrunge\"), or just plain silly (\"y'alternative\" 🤠). It's possible to get a sense of what a genre is supposed to refer to by listening to songs tagged with it, but it's also useful to understand the genres in the context of the timeframe from which its constituent songs come. Furthermore, many genres of music evolve significantly over time—compare Future to Run-DMC or Johnny Cash to Florida Georgia Line, for example. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this next task, help by completing the `genre_frequency_over_time()` function to generate a bar chart counting the number of songs matching a given genre in all years between its first appearance in the dataset to its last. The chart must be a bar chart with a title **that displays the name of the genre** and helpful x- and y- axes labels. (You can make it look nicer if you like—coloring the bars by release year could be a lot of fun!) By using [`plot()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Series.plot.html), you should be able to finish this task in just one or two additional lines of code. Keep in mind that `by_year`—the data you should be plotting—is a `Series`, so you won't need to specify the columns to use for the x and y dimensions."

    "For the final part of this assignment, you are given a model that is designed to estimate the probability of whether some **new** song would fit into my library or not. You are tasked with running some cells here and thinking critically about the model as it has been described. You will not write code here, but you will have to answer a few open-ended questions and provide some justification. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main hypothesis that drives the model we have built is that the songs that I have saved to my library might tend to fit a certain profile. Maybe my taste is, for example, happy, high-energy, acoustic-sounding music. In order to prove that, it will be important to have examples of songs that are not currently among my Liked Songs. \n",
    "\n",
    "These come from an anonymous friend—let's call her \"E\"—and are found in the file called `other_songs.csv`. By introducing songs that come from another library—from another person with a different taste for music—we might introduce some examples that have notably different musical profiles. This will give our model a notion of what music outside of my personal taste might look like so that it can learn to identify examples of it. Then, the model will be tasked with estimating the probability that a song with a certain profile comes from my library instead of E's library.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is actually built using the steps outlined in the included `building_a_model.ipynb`. You do not have to read anything or run any code found in that notebook, but it does show you how the model is built if you're curious. We can load the model using the following cell:"

E actually beat me to the punch in this case, and the song is already present in her library! We actually told the model that \"Red Wine Supernova\" is one of E's songs when we were teaching it the difference between my songs and hers. This reveals one of the challenges of probabilistic models trained on lots of data: models like this are responsible for capturing large, overarching patterns, and so the model can learn patterns that contradict individual examples.

    "\"not Harry Songs\" were songs that came from the anonymous friend \"E\" and were in the other_songs.csv library. The characteristics of those songs were compared to characteristics of the songs that were \"Harry Songs\" so the model could get an idea of what songs outside of Harry's taste looked like. Then the model compared the characteristics of each song it tested with Harry's songs and other songs to determine if it fit into Harry's taste. However, \"not Harry Songs\" just came from a singular person's data, so the results generated could be inaccurate. For example, if a song is Harry's preference but is more E's preference, the model would determine that it is not Harry's preference. Therefore, the model more so determines if a song is more E's preference or Harry's rather than comparing it to songs in general."
