    "Pandas' `read_csv()` function allows you to create a DataFrame that contains the data stored inside of a given CSV file. The function has a huge number of options that you can pass in as *keyword arguments* in order to change how the CSV file is interpreted. You can review all of these options in [the Pandas documentation here.](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html) In this case, `read_csv()` should get all of the data successfully with the default options, but the datatypes that it chooses may not always be the best ones. In particular, the `Album Release Date` column will be interpreted as a string by default. This is not \"wrong\", but it will make certain tasks more difficult later on. How you handle this is up to you—the following are three (of several possible) choices for how to handle this typing issue:\n",
    "1. Choose a setting for `read_csv()` that forces Pandas to parse the column as a `datetime` object. (Less code but more documentation reading.)\n",
    "2. Replace the column after reading the CSV by using [`to_datetime()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.to_datetime.html). In particular, you should be aware that some dates have Day, Month, and Year whereas some have just the Year. You could almost say that the format is *\"mixed\"...*(Less code but more documentation reading.)\n",
    "3. Keep the column's type as a string and just parse out the year yourself. (Less reading but more code.)\n",

This will give our model a notion of what music outside of my personal taste might look like so that it can learn to identify examples of it. Then, the model will be tasked with estimating the probability that a song with a certain profile comes from my library instead of E's library.\n",
